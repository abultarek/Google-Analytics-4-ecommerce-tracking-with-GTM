# Google-Analytics-4-ecommerce-tracking-with-GTM
I have set up Google Analytics (GA4) e-commerce tracking and Facebook pixel standard e-commerce tracking for a USA-based world-first massage chair brand. I did set up their Google Analytics 4 standard enhanced E-commerce tracking (view_item, add_to_cart, checkout, and purchase) with Google Tag Manager, and also set up meta pixel standard e-commerce events with GTM.
